sudo gem install mysql2

Database setup
- Use a MYSQL RDS host, t2.small will do it
- Log in on the command line as the 'master user' you set while setting it up. 'root' is prohibited so don't try that.
- CREATE DATABASE thermo;
- GRANT ALL ON thermo.* TO '<YOUR MASTER USER>'@'localhost';
- CREATE USER 'nestwriter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<GENERATE A PASSWORD FOR NEST USER AND PUT IT IN YOUR CONFIG>';
- GRANT INSERT ON thermo.* TO 'nestwriter'@'localhost';

Create the db
mysql -h <YOUR RDS HOST>.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u <YOUR MASTER USER> -p  thermo < db/create_database.sql
